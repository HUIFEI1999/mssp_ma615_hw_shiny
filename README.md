Make a shiny app for exploring data about Boston.  Use Analyze Boston.
<br>
The app should have a tabbed interface with at least 3 tabs --
  one that presents a map based on data that includes exact locations that are reported as lat-lon.  Use ggplot to produce a map.
  one that presents a table that does not rely on location, and
  one that refers to loacations that are indexed by neighborhood, district, or zone.  Use mapping data available on the Analyze Boston website.
Form groups of 3 or 4.  Publish the Shiny app before class on Monday.
This assignemnt is due before class on Monday.  We will use peer greading that will be explained on Friday when the class will be based on questions you ask about this assinment.
